# Pending copy and open decisions

Everything the build is waiting on, and every deviation logged rather than
silently taken. Nothing here blocks Step 1.

Items marked **client** need Iram. Items marked **Saif** are ours. Items marked
**logged** are decided and recorded so they can be reversed cheaply.

## 1. Copy still with the client

Each of these lives in `src/content/` behind a `TODO(client)` marker and renders
as an empty block until the real text lands. No placeholder figures, no invented
client names.

| # | Item | Spec § | Owner | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Eighteen constraint commentary blocks: per domain, three to four sentences on what the constraint costs, three checks to run this week, and one recommendation paragraph | 7.2, deep 8.4 | client | Report email, both diagnostics |
| 1.2 | Homepage result card 6: a count of bespoke builds shipped, or manual hours removed per month | 3.3, 10 #4 | **Saif** | Homepage results band |
| 1.3 | Confirmation of result cards 4 and 5 against the master table | 3.3, 10 #4 | client | Homepage results band |
| 1.4 | Master results table sign-off. Operational waste is published as both "40 to 60% reduction" and "10 to 40% reduction". These cannot both be true and the spec calls it a direct contradiction | 9, 10 #5 | client | Homepage, About, case studies |
| 1.5 | Final wording for the contingent fee section. No percentage or formula is to be published | 3.10, 10 #3 | client | Homepage 3.10 |
| 1.6 | Which team members appear, with photographs and one-line credentials | 6.3, 10 #2 | client | About team layer |
| 1.7 | Which clients may be named, confirmed in writing | 3.8, 10 #1 | client | Case studies, logo bar |
| 1.8 | Privacy policy legal sign-off by a UAE-qualified adviser | 2.7 | client | `/privacy`, both diagnostics, all three API routes |
| 1.9 | Founder portrait at full resolution, plus the two article URLs for the proof bar | 8.1, 10 #8 | client | Homepage 3.7, About 6.1, proof bar |
| 1.10 | CRM, dashboard and Scentmatic assets, client data blurred | 8.1, 10 #8 | **Saif** | Technology Builds |
| 1.11 | Homepage services card 6 body. The spec reads "START WITH THE DIAGNOSTIC (TEXT AS PER CARD SHOWN)" and the card it refers to is an image, so there is no transcribable copy | 3.4 | client | Homepage 3.4, `/services` |
| 1.12 | RAKEZ activity scope confirmation for selling software as a standalone product | 10 #7 | client | Technology Builds going live |

## 2. Spec contradictions, logged and worked around

### 2.1 The fractional service slug — **logged, decided**

The spec gives two URLs for one page:

- §2.1 "New URLs required" lists `/services/fractional-coo`
- §4.2 defines the page as `/services/fractional-leadership`, and the §3.4 card button points there

**Decided:** hold `/services/fractional-coo`. The slug and the nav label match, and
it is the term searched in this market. The H1 stays "Fractional Leadership" as
§4.2 wrote it, because the page covers COO, Chief of Staff and CFO seats. A
permanent redirect from `/services/fractional-leadership` means either link
resolves. Iram to be told, not to be waited on.

### 2.2 The Chief of Staff anchor — **logged, decided**

§4.2 instructs "build the three anchors: `#coo`, `#chief-of-staff` and `#cfo`",
then eleven lines later labels the seat `#cos`.

**Decided:** `#chief-of-staff` is canonical. `#cos` is handled as a client-side
hash alias that rewrites on load, so any link already sent out still lands.

### 2.3 Persona headlines: spec against mockup — **client**

§§5.1 to 5.4 say to keep the existing persona H1s verbatim, describing them as
the strongest writing on the site. `req/pivotprime-persona-pages.html` carries
four completely different ones.

| Live and in this repo (spec says keep) | Mockup |
|---|---|
| You've created something real. | You're a founder, and everything still depends on you. |
| Revenue is increasing, but margins are uneven. | You are running an SME that is growing but not settled. |
| You're carrying delivery, risk, and outcomes | You're expected to drive results, but you are alone in the execution. |
| You are responsible for the whole system. | You are accountable for the P&L, across teams, markets and moving parts. |

**Built as:** the spec version, the live copy. If Iram confirms the mockup is the
later approval, the swap is one line per page. Saif is asking her directly.

### 2.4 Two homepage sections with no place in the spec order — **logged, relocated not deleted**

The homepage currently carries two sections that do not appear anywhere in the
3.1 to 3.12 running order:

- "We don't just understand your challenges. We fix what's really holding your business back"
- "We've sat in the system. Now we help reshape it."

**Decided:** neither is deleted. Both move into the About page content under §6.1,
where "We've sat in the system" reads as authority copy rather than homepage
filler. The homepage renders the twelve specified sections and nothing else.
Iram can veto the move without anyone rewriting copy.

## 3. Build deviations found in the existing code

### 3.1 The deep diagnostic screen structure — **resolved, built to spec**

Deep spec §8.2 says "One domain per screen, seven statements visible together,
with a progress indicator showing six steps." The implementation interleaved
instead, round-robining across all six domains so every page mixed all six.

**Built to spec.** Six domain-titled screens of seven statements each.

The straight-lining risk that the interleave was reaching for is handled without
breaking §8.2: statement order is randomised **within** each domain screen, per
session. Seven near-identical statements in a fixed column is what invites a
straight run down one point of the scale, and shuffling inside the block removes
that without moving a statement between domains.

Scoring is unaffected. Statements now carry a stable, spec-derived id, so the
exported answers key on identity rather than on the position a statement happened
to render at. Re-run comparison holds and the twelve short-instrument anchors
still map.

### 3.1a The six discarded thematic page titles — **client, if wanted**

The interleaved layout carried six thematic section titles. They belonged to a
structure where a page genuinely had no single subject, and they appear in
neither the website spec nor the diagnostic document, so they are not sanctioned
copy. Section titles are now the domain names from spec §7.1.

Recorded here in case Iram wants them back as section furniture, for example as a
strapline under the domain name:

1. How the business runs today
2. Where the money actually goes
3. What happens under pressure
4. Who owns what
5. What the numbers tell you
6. What is holding the ceiling down

Note they were written against the old page order, so they do not map one to one
onto the six domains as they now stand.

### 3.2 Joint-constraint reporting is narrower than the spec — **logged**

Deep spec §4.4 says "where two are within three points of each other, present
them as joint". The implementation only ever marks the second-ranked domain as
joint with the first. Two domains tied at ranks three and four are not marked.
Low impact, since the report leads on the primary constraint, but it is not what
the spec describes.

## 4. Colours

### 4.1 The six off-palette values — **resolved**

All six are resolved and applied. The palette stays at five.

| Hex | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `#093524` | Dark section background on 8 files | Collapsed to `#013325`. The two differ by 8 on red and 2 elsewhere, the same colour typed twice |
| `#4fb968` | Homepage sub-headings | Replaced by context, not by value: `mid` on light, `neon` on dark, which is the mockups' own `.g` / `.ondark .g` rule |
| `#123e2d` | Card surface on dark | `rgba(255,255,255,.05)`, derived from forest |
| `#21533e` | Card border on dark | `rgba(255,255,255,.14)` |
| `#164b36` | Card hover | `rgba(255,255,255,.08)` |
| `#21352b` | Marquee divider | `rgba(255,255,255,.14)` |

Spec 3.9 tags the persona cards KEEP. That covers the design intent of the
cards, not the four hexes someone reached for to build them, so deriving the
surfaces from the forest token sits inside the tag rather than against it.

### 4.2 The mockups disagree with each other on the neon — **logged**

`req/pivotprime-diagnostic-deep v2 mock up.html` declares `--neon:#22c55e`.
Every other mockup declares `--neon:#00d76d`, and `#00d76d` is what the swatch
plate in the copy spec shows. This is a mockup inconsistency, not a developer
error: the deep diagnostic was built faithfully to a mockup that was itself off.

**Standardised on `#00d76d` site-wide.** Worth telling whoever produced the
mockups, so the next export does not reintroduce it.

### 4.3 Deliberately off-palette — **enforced**

`#25D366` on the floating WhatsApp button is Meta's mandated brand green. It is
registered in `scripts/palette-allow.json` with the reason, and carries a comment
at the usage site, so nobody "fixes" it to `--color-neon` in three months.

### 4.4 Three leftovers not covered by the six — **open, low priority**

These predate the rebuild, live only in `globals.css`, and were not part of the
six resolved above, so they have not been touched.

| Token | Hex | Reached through |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-primary-dark` | `#008744` | `hover:bg-primary-dark`, used site-wide on buttons |
| `--color-dark` | `#121212` | No current usage found |
| `--color-light` | `#f5f5f5` | No current usage found |

`--color-primary-dark` is the live one: it is the hover state on every primary
button. The mockups do hover with opacity rather than a second green, so the
consistent fix is to drop the token and hover on alpha. Not done unasked,
because it changes every button on the site.
